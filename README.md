hid-apple
======================

A Linux driver fixed for Apple Wireless Keyboard 2011.

"fn" key of Apple Wireless Keyboard 2011 does not work on a driver used on Ubuntu 12.04,
because it's driver is generic-blooth driver.

In terminal:

```sh
$ dmesg | grep bluetooth
[   37.652063] input: SOME_DEVIDE_NAME as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.8/2-1.8:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:43/input13
[   37.652131] generic-bluetooth 0005:05AC:0255.0007: input,hidraw4: BLUETOOTH HID v0.50 Keyboard ...
```

[kui/hid-apple][] driver is a fixed hid-apple driver for the above problem.
